This React project is designed as a Christmas e-card. It features dynamic elements like snowfall, background music, and changing background images. The core functionalities are built using React and various libraries to enhance the user experience. The primary features include:

- Snowfall Effect: Utilizing "react-snowfall" for a festive snow effect.
- Background Music: Integration of a portion of "All I Want for Christmas Is You" converted to MP3, with a fade-out effect applied.
- Interactive Background: Changing the background image with an onClick event.
- Glow Effect: A Gaussian filter applied to SVGs, thanks to the "vara" library, creating a glowing effect.
- Sound Effects: Using "use-sound" for interactive sound feedback.

Additionally, the project includes an unimplemented 'Deck' component intended for future development.

## Unlikely Further Development
- Refactoring for Maintainability: Plan to refactor the codebase to improve maintainability.
- Deck Component: Consider completing the implementation of the 'Deck' component.

## Notes

- The project was a personal endeavor to create a special Christmas e-card.

- Dall-E 2 was used for generating images, adding a unique and personalized touch to the e-card.
